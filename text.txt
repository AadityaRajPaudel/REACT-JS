1.
  Why react? Because its less imperative(how the program does: complete steps/code given) and more declarative(what the program does: more abstraction), meaning we dont need long JS code just to append an element that contains some content and its class name. (this takes 4 lines at min), whereas JSX allows this in single line through ReactDOM.render(html_content, destination)

2.
  ReactDOM is a global variable available by importing react-dom library

3.
  function Element(){  // note capital E
    return (
      <div> Div </div>
    )
  }
  ReactDOM.render(<Element/>, ...) // <Element/> --> calling or instantiating a component
  A function that returns a react element is called component

4.
  JSX is a syntax extension of JS that allows us to write HTML code within JS code. It is more readable.

5. 
  Components return React elements (or return HTML elements or objects)
  React components are aka UI.
  React elements are normal objects in react representing a DOM element. Eg: const root = <h1> This is a DOM element </h1>
  'root' is react element

6. 
  VITE:
  Building React App gets much quicker with quick bundling time using esbuild. 
  Unlike 
    npx create-react-app
    cd my-app
    npm start
  Vite uses:
    npm create vite@latest
    select name, framework, script type
    npm install
    npm run dev

// newer version
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
  root.render(<App/>);

  # main.jsx only displays the <App/>
  # App.jsx takes child components

7. In summary, Node.js is the runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server, while Express.js is a framework that makes it easier to build web applications and APIs using Node.js.
